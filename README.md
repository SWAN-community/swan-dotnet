# Secured Web Addressability Network (SWAN) - dotNet Access Layer

Secure Web Addressability Network (SWAN) - an open source secure and privacy
supporting cross domain identity network implemented in dotNet.

## Introduction

This project contains all the server side components that are needed to
implement SWAN in dotNet for a publisher, Consent Management Platform (CMP) or
OpenRTB party.

The project wraps calls to SWAN API endpoints in a simple to use data model. A
connection is used to configure the mandatory parameters such as the host domain
for the SWAN Operator access node, access keys and default optional parameters
such as the message to display to the user when performing multiple node storage
operations.

## Prerequisites

The reader should be familiar with the [SWAN concepts](https://github.com/SWAN-community/swan).
